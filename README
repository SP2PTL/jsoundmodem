Welcome to jsoundmodem,

this project was set up to enable APRSDroid to communicate via transceivers.
Therefore it is still very limited right now.

Working features:
	- Afsk modulator
	- APRSFrame packet builder
	- generic Message class to store not byte-aligned messages and their
	  length in bits. (Being unaligned is a painful property of messages
	  after being bit stuffed

Next to come:
	- I'm thinking of an Afsk demodulator
	- Extending the APRSFrame packet builder to a generic APRS packet
	  handler
